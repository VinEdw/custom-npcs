# Custom NPCs JSDoc Annotations

The goal of this project was to build the JSDoc annotations so that Intellisense in VSCode can understand the tree structure of the [Custom NPCs mod API](http://www.kodevelopment.nl/customnpcs/api/1.16.5/overview-tree.html).
If you wish to utilize this when writing JavaScript, the simplest method seems to be to download `docs.js`, open that in your first tab in VSCode, and then write code as normal.
